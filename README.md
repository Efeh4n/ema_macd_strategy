In this project, if the ema 50 value is above the 200 value, the macd signals are examined and if the macd goes above the macd_signal, this means a buying opportunity. Conversely, if the ema50 value falls below the ema200 value and the macd goes below the macd_signal, this is a sell signal. 3 atr is calculated for take profit and 2 atr for stop loss, you can change this according to your own strategy.
